For this project I choose the ATM system project! I used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. We defined the ATM Class, implemented withdrawal, implemented deposit, implement Balance Check and more! 


Features: 
* Generate and change a PIN
* Check their balance
* Withdraw and deposit money
